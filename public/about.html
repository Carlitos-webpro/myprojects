<h1>About Carlitos!!!</h1>

<p> I'm basically a life multi-professional!!. Native of Colombia, grew up there, lived in the US for about eight years<br />
    and came back to my home country Colombia, to deveolp myself professionaly. <br />
    I decided to study Physical Education, Recreation and Sports, <br />
    while I workked on managing computer systems and basic networking for the school I graduated in.<br />
    When I finished my P.E. studies in 2015, <br /> 
    and immediately started working as a Table Tennis teacher/coach at Corporations, schools and universities <br />
    between 2015 and the end of 2021.    
</p>

<p> After some time, once I developed myself in every field of the Table Tennis world in my city, <br />
  I found myself not happy with the qualify of life I was getting as a coach <br />
  and the constante instability of the working hours I had, <br />
  so I decided to change my profession to customer service, basically entering the call center world. <br />
  This change of profession was actually very motivating, <br />
  as I have found myself, constantly being top performer in whichever area I was in, <br />
  including banking customer service, cold calling sales and finally collections, where is where I'm at right now.<br />  
</p>

<p>Now, in the beginning of this 2024, I actually remembered an old tip from my mom from when I was a kid.<br />
  She told me, "Carlitos, you have to study systems engineering, it is the future".<br />
  At that time I didn't pay much attention to it, however, I find myself thinking she could not be more right.<br />
</p>

<p>This got me to actually motivate my to study and learn programming,<br />
  something I was actully already putting in practice in the past, <br />
  when I developed websites on my own, with basic HTML en 2010,<br />
  and thenn, by using web developing apps such as Joomla, Wordpress and Shopify.<br />
  Now, I can count at least 5 or 6 projects I designed on my own, <br />
  and I really loved it when I did them, so if this is a profession that actually engages me to learn more,<br />
  to deveolp myself every day, and somethinig I enjoy, well, <br />
  I think I should give it a good try, invest time and resources on it, and give it my all,<br />
  so I can become the best developer I can be, work on it, get some gains,<br />
  and then, decide if I want this for my future, while in the meantime, I look to fin my economic freedom<br />.
</p>

<p>I really hpe this is it, I'm good at it, but learning more every day,<br />
  so, I might as well give it a good try.<br />
  I will give it a shot, because in the end, it's like giving me an oportunity <br />
  for doing something I know will provide me a bright future, make my happy and proud of myself<br />
